This week I haven't hear anything back from programmer, and I think we should do more communication.\
I made the itch.io page for the game and I find out I had little piece of art to use. So I can only use some color as our background and make it fit the theme of the game.\
I am not good with wording, so I might need to improve the game description next week.
