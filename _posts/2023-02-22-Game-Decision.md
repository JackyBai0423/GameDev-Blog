After the review of Prof. Berland, we decided to go with the second game idea, which is the grocery chess game. We are planning about what we should do to get our MVP done.\
I think as the designer the job I should do is to make a more detailed rule about the game. Also I am willing to help with the programming jobs in case it is heavy for one person\
Hopefully we will get our job done by next Thursday. ðŸ™‚
