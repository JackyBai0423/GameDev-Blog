## Game Loop created!

To start with, my role in the group is designer.</br>
This week we came up with 3 game ideas. </br>
The first one is a game about building a small cozy house in the wood. The player need to interact with animals in the wood to get material and their help. The goal of the game is to finish the house.</br>
