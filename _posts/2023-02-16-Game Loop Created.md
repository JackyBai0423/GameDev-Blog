## Game Loop created!

To start with, my role in the group is designer.</br>
This week we came up with 3 game ideas. </br>
The first one is a game about building a small cozy house in the wood. The player need to interact with animals in the wood to get material and their help. The goal of the game is to finish the house.</br>

The second one is a kind of chess game. The game happens in a grocery store, where 2 groups of people (player and AI) play against each other to obtain as many object as possible.</br>

The third game is a card game, which I think is similar to Hearthstone. Players draw card and cards have different effect. It is also a player vs AI game.
